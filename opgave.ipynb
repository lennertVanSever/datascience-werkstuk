    "## üìñ Background\n",
    "You are employed by the local government's environmental agency, and you're currently leading a project focused on establishing areas that are conducive to pollinator bees. You can use both native and non-native plants to make these areas friendly for bees. It's essential to pick the right plants to make sure the bee environment is the best it can be. The team has gathered information about native and non-native plants and how they impact pollinator bees. Your job is to study this data and offer suggestions on which plants are best for creating an ideal habitat for pollinator bees."
